# GEOL0013_geoengineering

In this practical we will analyze the climate response to stratospheric aerosol geoengineering using results from the Geoengineering Large Ensemble (GLENS) runs. You can find out more about the GLENS runs here: https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/BAMS-D-17-0267.1

# 0. Download the "data" folder which contains the netcdf files we will be using for the project. Note you will need >2 GB of space on your hard drive.
